### Custom method mapping in MapStruct

In most of the mapping scenarios mapped attribute has the same type in the source and target objects, but in some scenarios it can be required to manually implement a specific mapping from one type to another which can’t be generated automatically by MapStruct. 
MapStruct handle this kind of scenario through custom methods.

For example let's assume the mapping of mobileNumbers attribute requires some special logic (Integer -> "+91-"+mobileNumber) which can’t be generated by MapStruct. You could then define the custom method like below:

	default List<String> addCountryCode(List<Integer> mobileNumbers) {
		return mobileNumbers.stream().map(number -> "+91-" + number).collect(Collectors.toList());
	}
	
If there are multiple attributes with same data type and you need different functionality than we can use @Named annotation.
In this scenario you could then define the custom method like below:

	@Named("addZero")
	default List<String> addZero(List<Integer> mobileNumbers) {
		return mobileNumbers.stream().map(number -> "0" + number).collect(Collectors.toList());
	}

### Note: 
Remember that method name doesn't matter, you can use any method name.
